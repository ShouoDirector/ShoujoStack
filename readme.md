## üéÅ Contributing, Issues & Pull Requests

Feel free to create issue tickets to request new features or to report bugs & problems. Just please follow the template given when creating the issue.

Pull requests are welcome but, unless it's a small tweak, it may be best to open the pull request early or create an issue for your intended change to discuss how it will fit into the project and plan out the merge. Just because a feature request exists, or is tagged, does not mean that feature would be accepted into the core project.
